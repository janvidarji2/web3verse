A single-page Web3 educational website built for the **Arbitrum Builder Pods** assignment.  
All 4 sections live in one HTML file — navigate without any page reload.

## Pages

| Page | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| 🏠 **Home** | Landing page — hero with animated chain visual, 6 Web3 features, how blockchain works (4 steps), explore section|
| 📚 **Concepts** | 4 side-by-side comparisons: Web2 vs Web3, Ethereum vs Bitcoin (table), Public vs Private Key, Blockchain vs Traditional DB |
| 📈 **Live Prices** | Real-time ETH, BTC, SOL, MATIC, ARB, ADA from CoinGecko API — 24h change with ▲/▼ arrows, sparklines, coin filter |
| ⛏️ **Block Simulator** | Real SHA-256 proof-of-work — mine Block 1, change its data, Block 2 breaks instantly (immutability demo) |

## How to Run

**Option 1 — Just open in browser:**
```
Double-click web3.html
```

**Option 2 — Local server (recommended for CoinGecko API):**
```bash
python -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

**Option 3 — VS Code Live Server** (right-click index.html → Open with Live Server)

## Tech Stack

- **Web Crypto API** (`crypto.subtle`) — real browser-native SHA-256
- **CoinGecko Public API** — no API key needed
- **Google Fonts** — Syne + Inter + JetBrains Mono
